# cse576-final-project

Object detection is a major challenge in computer vision, involving both object
classification and object localization within a scene. The present architecture
of many object detection algorithms are still far too heavy for mobiles. In this
project, we try to access the performance of light weight neural network architec-
tures for real time object detection on mobiles. We train one such architecture
on an auonomous driving based 2D object detection dataset and examine if an
object detection pipeline running entirely on smarphones be used for autonomous
navigation.
